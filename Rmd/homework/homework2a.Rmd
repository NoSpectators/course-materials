**Part A: Optimizing the serial code**

[GitHub classroom repository: click here to get your team's starter fiels](https://classroom.github.com/g/8hZTAA3_)

## Problem statement

Your goal is to parallelize on XSEDE's
[Bridges](https://portal.xsede.org/psc-bridges) supercomputer a toy particle
simulator (similar particle simulators are used in
[mechanics](http://www.thp.uni-duisburg.de/~kai/index_1.html),
[biology](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/),
[astronomy](http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/clusters/index.html), etc.)
that reproduces the behaviour shown in the following animation:

![Animation of particle simulation](/img/animation.gif)

The range of interaction forces *(cutoff)* is limited as shown in grey for a
selected particle. Density is set sufficiently low so that given *n* particles,
only *O(n)* interactions are expected.

Suppose we have a code that runs in time *T = O(n)* on a single processor. Then
we'd hope to run in time *T/p* when using *p* processors. We'd like you to
write parallel codes that approach these expectations.

## Correctness and Performance

A simple correctness check which computes the minimal distance between 2
particles during the entire simulation is provided. A correct simulation
will have particles stay at greater than *0.4* (of cutoff) with typical
values between *0.7-0.8*. A simulation were particles don't interact
correctly will be less than *0.4* (of cutoff) with typical values
between *0.01-0.05* . More details as well as an average distance are
described in the source file.

The code we are providing will do this distance check based on the calls
to the interaction function but the full autograder will do the checks
based on the outputted txt file. We'd recommend keeping the correctness
checker in your code, but depending on performance desires it can be
deleted as long as the simulation can still output a correct txt file.

The performance of the code is determined by doing multiple runs of the
simulation with increasing particle numbers and then running a benchmarking
script written in Python on the simulation outputs. This can be done
automatically with the *auto-\** scripts.

### Important note for Performance:

While the scripts we are providing have small numbers of particles (500-1000)
to allow for the *O(n<sup>2</sup>)* algorithm to finish
execution, the final codes will be tested with values 100 times larger
(50000-100000) to better see their performance.

## Grading

25% of your grade will be based on your code's efficiency, and 75% of your grade will depend on your report.

**Serial Code** performance will be tested via fitting multiple runs of the
code to a line on a log/log plot and calculating the slope of that line. This
will determine whether your code is attaining the *O(n)* desired complexity
versus the starting *O(n<sup>2</sup>)*. With an achieved result of
*O(n<sup>x</sup>)* you will receive

*   If *x* is between 2 and 1.5 you will receive a serial score between 0 and
    90 proportional to *x*. (Ex:1.75 gives a score of 45)

*   If *x* is between 1.5 and 1.4 you will receive a serial score between 90
    and 100 proportional to *x*. (Ex:1.44 gives a score of 96)

*   If *x* is below 1.4 you will receive a serial score of 100.

## Report

This homework will be completed in groups, and each group must submit a single joint report.

The report is to be written in a style appropriate for an academic journal with any relevant citations provided in a bibliography. The report should only discuss the details of the final version of your submitted code. The report is to contain the following:

1.  An introduction to the problem

2.  A section detailing how you optimized the code. This requires both a conceptual discussion,
for example how you partitioned the space in the problem (figures are helpful!), and a code summary, where you explain each important step in your solution (this should be supported with code snippets).

3.  A benchmark section where you show how your code performs against the naive implementation,
and how it scales with respect to the appropriate parameters.
    Figures are helpful when reporting this data!
    Benchmark data should be taken from runs performed on Bridges, not your local computer or laptop.
    Make sure you discuss the reason for any odd behavior in the reported performance.

Your report should be converted to the PDF format prior to submission.
The filename should follow this format: `Team#_hw2a.pdf`.

## How to submit

Put your report file `Team#_hw2a.pdf` into the `doc/` directory in your GitHub repository, and save, commit, and push the report and the final version of your code into the master branch.
Do not push the `particles` binary or any temporary files (such as `.o` files) to GitHub (the `.gitignore` file is meant to help prevent this).
After everything is pushed and up-to-date, do the following:

1.  Have **one** group member upload the report PDF to the Homework 2a assignment posted on Blackboard.

2.  Have **each** group member navigate to the group's repository on the GitHub website, click the green `Clone or download` button, and click **Download ZIP**.
    Rename the zipfile to `Team#_hw2a.zip` (replace `#` with your team's number) and upload it to the [Moodle](https://moodle.xsede.org) site.

## Source code

You will start with the serial implementation supplied below, which runs in *O(n<sup>2</sup>)* time,
which is unacceptably inefficient.

*   **src/cli.cpp** (DO NOT EDIT) and **vendor/CLI/CLI11.hpp** (DO NOT EDIT)

    *   Unified interface for defining and controlling command-line options

*   **src/serial.cpp** and **src/serial.hpp**

    *   a serial implementation

*   **src/common.cpp** and **src/common.hpp**

    *   an implementation of common functionality, such as I/O, numerics and timing

*   **CMakeLists.txt** (DO NOT EDIT) and **src/CMakeLists.txt**

    *   cmake configuration files for compiling your code. Compiler flags and the full list of source files to compile can be edited in **src/CMakeLists.txt**.

*   **job-bridges-serial**

    *   sample batch files to launch jobs on Bridges. Use *sbatch* to submit on Bridges. Use these files to check correctness

*   **auto-bridges-serial**

    *   sample batch files to launch autograder jobs on Bridges. Use *sbatch* to submit on Bridges. Use these files to check performance

*   **scripts/hw2-visualize/animate.py**

    *   A Python script for animating the particle trajectories generated by the simulation. Requires a recent version of Anaconda to be installed. Imagemagick must also be installed to generate animated gif files. `ffmpeg` must also be installed to render mp4 movie files. Look in **job-bridges-serial** for an example on how to generate the animations.

*   **scripts/hw2-autograder/hw2-autograder.py**

    *   A Python script for grading the scaling of your code. Requires a recent version of Anaconda to be installed. Look in **auto-bridges-serial** for an example on how to run the autograder.

## Logging in to Bridges

The easiest way to access the machines is to login directly with your own ssh client to **login.xsede.org** and from there **gsissh** into the correct machine.
You need to set up two-factor authentication with Duo in order to use the single sign-on hub.
More information on is available here on the [single login system][xsede-single-login].

An example of logging on to XSEDE would be to first connect to the single sign-on hub:

    ssh XSEDE-username@login.xsede.org

Enter your password and complete the 2-factor authentication request.
Then, run the following to hop over to Bridges:

    gsissh bridges

Another way to login to XSEDE resources is via the [Accounts tab][xsede-accounts-tab] in XSEDE User Portal.
To reach this page login to XSEDE User Portal, navigate to MY XSEDE tab and from there select the Accounts page.
All machines you have access to will have a **login** option next to them that will launch OpenSSH via a Java Applet.

Please be aware that most XSEDE resources are not available via direct ssh and all requests must go through the XSEDE single login system.

To clone the files from your Github copy, use the following command:

    git clone git@github.com:mason-sp19-csi-702-003/homework-2a-YOURTEAMNAME.git

## Compiling the code

Instead of a regular Makefile, compilation is handled via CMake.
For your convenience, a simple script file named `make.sh` is included that will automatically compile your code on Bridges.
From the root directory of this repository, simply run:

```
./make.sh
```

Your code should compile, and the compiled binary will be placed into a folder called `bin/`.
Running this after you make a change to the code will recompile the changed file and update the binary.

If you are developing on your local computer using the virtual machine, you can compile the code by running:

```
./make.sh vm
```

If you aren't using the virtual machine, then the wrapper script might not work and you'll need to run CMake manually.
If you are unfamiliar with how to use CMake, you can open `make.sh ` with your text editor to get an idea of how to use it.

## Submitting and running the code

The jobs queue on Bridges is managed via the [SLURM scheduler][slurm-info].
To submit a job, use the `sbatch` command like so:

    sbatch job-bridges-serial

To check the status of your running jobs you can use the following command:

    squeue -u $USER

Append a `-l` flag will print additional information about the running jobs.
If you want even more information, consider using the `sacct` command, for example:

    sacct -j $JOBID --format JobID,ReqMem,MaxRSS,TotalCPU,State

where `$JOBID` is the ID number of the job.

If you want to cancel a job, run:

    scancel $JOBID

If you would like to receive emails for job submissions add the following lines to the submission scripts.
This sometimes helps tracking down issues.

    #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
    #SBATCH --mail-user=youremailaddress

For more details on SLURM commands please see [Bridges documentation page][cluster-slurm].

Finally, there is an interactive mode that allows you to request computing nodes, but maintain a command line.
This is ideal for prototyping and debugging purposes.
To activate this mode, type

    interact -N 1

The `interact.sh` script included in the repository provides you with a reminder on how to activate the interactive session.
For additional information, [read the documentation on interactive sessions][interact-documentation].

## CLI interface

When testing the code on a local computer or within an interactive session on Bridges, you will use a simple command-line interface to launch the simulation.
For Part A, there is only one runtime mode: "serial".
The "serial" mode is also the default.

Running `./bin/particles -h` will bring up the help:

    Usage: ./bin/particles [OPTIONS] [mode]
    
    Positionals:
      mode TEXT in {serial}
    
    Particle simulation run modes
      serial:   (default) Serial version of simulation.
    
    Options:
      -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
      -n INT=1000                 Set the number of particles
      -o,--output TEXT            Specify the output file name
      -s,--summary TEXT           Specify the summary file name
      --no                        Turn off all correctness checks and outputs

The most important options are `-n`, `-o`, and `-s`.
The `-n` option lets you control the number of particles in the simulation.
The `-o` option lets you output a history of the particle positions to a file, which can be used to generate an animated gif or mp4 file.
The `-s` option lets you save the amount of time it takes to run a simulation for a given number of particles to a file. If the file exists, then new benchmark results are appended to the end of the file. The summary file will be used to compute your code grade.

For example, to run a particle simulation with 2000 particles that outputs the benchmark summary data to a file named `serial_summary.txt`, you would run:

    ./bin/particles -n 2000 -s serial_summary.txt

## File transfer

When copying files to and from Bridges, [you can use `scp` in conjunction with `data.bridges.psc.edu`][scp-2factor] to avoid having to copy your files to Single Site Login node first.
**This will work with the Two-Factor Authentication setup.**
Try running the following to copy files directly to Bridges:

    scp -P 2222 myfile XSEDE-username@data.bridges.psc.edu:/path/to/file

To copy from Bridges:

    scp -P 2222 XSEDE-username@data.bridges.psc.edu:/path/to/file myfile
