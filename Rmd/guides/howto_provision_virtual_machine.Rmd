## Installing Virtualbox and Vagrant

### Windows

Instructions below adapted from Ref. [[1](#if-curious-then-learn-blog)].

1.  Install the latest versions of the following software:

    *   **Git:** <https://git-scm.com/downloads>. Near the end of the install, select the option `Windows Explorer integration` so that `Git Bash Here` is added to your right-click menu.
    
    *   **Virtualbox:** <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>. The default settings are fine.
    
    *   **Vagrant:** <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>. The default settings are fine.
    
    After installing Vagrant, you will need to reboot your computer.

2.  Open Git bash by right-clicking your desktop or the white space inside a folder (Windows file explorer) and clicking `Git Bash Here`:

    If this is your first time using `git` on your Windows machine, you should set your user information by running these two commands:
    
    ```sh
    git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
    git config --global user.email "username@emailservice.com"
    ```
        
    Replace `FirstName LastName` and `username@emailservice.com` with your own information.

### macOS

Open a terminal window and follow the instructions below. Instructions adapted from Ref. [[2](#macos-setup-instructions)].

1.  Xcode must be installed before you can do anything else.
    You can install Xcode by either downloading it from Apple's website, https://developer.apple.com/xcode/, or by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```sh
    xcode-select --install
    ```
    
2.  (Possibly optional) Install XQuartz by downloading the `dmg` file from the project's website: <https://www.xquartz.org/>

3.  Install Homebrew if it is not currently installed on your computer:

    ```sh
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```
    
    Check your `$HOME/.bash_profile` file and see if `/usr/local/bin` is set in your `$PATH` environment variable.
    **If it is not**, run `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile` to append a command that will set it.
    **Close and reopen your terminal window after doing this**.
    
    To check that everything is working, run `brew doctor`.
    For basic information on what you can do with Homebrew, see this page: <http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Homebrew/Usage.html>.
    
4.  Install Homebrew-Cask if it is not already installed:

    ```sh
    brew tap caskroom/cask
    ```

5.  Install `git` using Homebrew:

    ```sh
    brew install git
    ```
    
6.  If this is your first time using `git`, you should set your user information by running these two commands:
    
    ```sh
    git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
    git config --global user.email "username@emailservice.com"
    ```
        
    Replace `FirstName LastName` and `username@emailservice.com` with your own information.

7.  Install Virtualbox using Homebrew-Cask:

    ```sh
    brew cask install virtualbox
    ```
    
8.  Install Vagrant using Homebrew-Cask:

    ```sh
    brew cask install vagrant
    brew cask install vagrant-manager
    ```

### Ubuntu

1.  Install `git` and `openssh-client` if you haven't already:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git openssh-client
    ```
    
2.  If this is your first time using `git`, you should set your user information by running these two commands:
    
    ```sh
    git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
    git config --global user.email "username@emailservice.com"
    ```
        
    Replace `FirstName LastName` and `username@emailservice.com` with your own information.

3.  Install the latest version of Virtualbox:

    ```sh
    wget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
    wget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian $(lsb_release -cs) contrib"
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install virtualbox-6.0
    ```
    
4.  Install the latest version of Vagrant:

    ```sh
    # Install gdebi if you haven't done so already
    sudo apt-get install gdebi
    # Download Vagrant
    wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.3/vagrant_2.2.3_x86_64.deb
    # Install Vagrant with gdebi
    sudo gdebi vagrant_2.2.3_x86_64.deb
    ```

## Provisioning the virtual machine

1.  Create a folder for the class, for example:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/Documents/class/csi702
    ```

    This will be the root folder for the virtual machine, so all files and directories related to the class will go under this folder.

2.  In your terminal window, navigate to the class folder you created in the previous step.
    Then, copy and paste the script below into your terminal window and run it to download the latest version of the files you'll use to provision the virtual machine:
    
    ```bash
    $(GIST_URL=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jkglasbrenner/a51b4de9a1088c7d8f6b5c5983738851/raw; \
      for gist_file_name in ansible.cfg DESCRIPTION environment.yml Makefile playbook.yml \
        requirements.yml Vagrantfile; \
        do \
          curl -OL ${GIST_URL}/${gist_file_name}; \
        done)
    ```
    
    If you have trouble getting the above script ot work, you can also navigate to the GitHub Gist <https://gist.github.com/jkglasbrenner/a51b4de9a1088c7d8f6b5c5983738851>, click `Download ZIP` and save the file to your class folder.
    Extract the file contents directly into the folder.
    If the files were unzipped into a new directory, move them into the class folder. 
    Regardless of the method, you should now see the following files in your class folder:

        /path/to/class/folder
        ├── ansible.cfg
        ├── DESCRIPTION
        ├── environment.yml
        ├── Makefile
        ├── playbook.yml
        ├── requirements.yml
        └── Vagrantfile  

    **Do not delete these files after setup.**

3.  Download the official base image for Ubuntu 18.04:

    ```sh
    vagrant box add ubuntu/bionic64
    ```
    
4.  Provision your virtual machine by running

    ```sh
    vagrant up
    ```
    
    **This will take a while.**
    Please note that this step needs to be done from within the class folder where you stored all the unzipped files.

5.  After the provisioning is complete, you can connect to the virtual machine by running

    ```sh
    vagrant ssh
    ```

## Install conda environment

1.  After connecting to your virtInstall conda environmentual machine with `vagrant ssh`, run the following commands to set up your conda environment:

    ```sh
    cd /vagrant
    make all
    ```
    
    **This will take several minutes to complete.**
    
2.  After `make all` is done, run:

    ```sh
    make clean
    ```

    This will remove anaconda's temporary files and free up some of your virtual disk space.

## Basic usage

After you install the conda environment, you are ready to start using your virtual machine in CSI 702.
Below are a few tips and reminders that are specific to using a Vagrant-provisioned virtual machine.
Otherwise, you are expected to be familiar with the basics of using a full Linux environment and navigating via the command line.

*   The steps in the [Install conda environment](#install-conda-environment) section created a conda virtual environment named `csi702`.
    To activate it, run:

    ```sh
    conda activate csi702
    ```

*   The `/vagrant` directory is a shared folder.
    If you followed the above directions, you should see any files and folders inside the class directory you created earlier.

*   You can serve a Jupyter Lab instance from within the virtual machine and access it using your host OS's web browser.
    The easy way to do this is:

    ```sh
    cd /vagrant
    make lab
    ```
    
    Open your web browser (Google Chrome or Firefox are recommended) and type `localhost:8888` in your address bar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    To stop the Jupyter Lab instance, just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> and answer `y` to the disconnect prompt.

*   To disconnect from your virtual machine, run:

    ```sh
    logout
    ```

*   The virtual machine will run in the background of your computer until you shut it down.
    To shut down the virtual machine, from the class folder, run:
    
    ```sh
    vagrant halt
    ```
    
    This can only be done **after** you've disconnected with `logout`.
    
*   To restart the virtual machine after running `vagrant halt`, from the class folder, run:

    ```sh
    vagrant up
    ```
    
*   To remove the virtual machine from your computer, from the class folder, run

    ```sh
    vagrant destroy
    ```
