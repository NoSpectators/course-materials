    "C++ is the primary language that we are using for this course, and it is worth your time to become familiar enough with the language as it is used in a lot of performance-critical code. The key phrase here is **performance-critical code**, C++ should be utilized when you encounter bottlenecks that cannot be addressed via other means. However, for any given scientific application, you will find that only a fraction of the total code base is dedicated to computations that need to be highly optimized. If this is the case, then what is the rest of the code doing? While each application is different, I wager that you'll still find that a significant portion of scientific code will be dedicated to defining a user interface (sometimes referred to as the API) and with completing tasks associated with data preprocessing and postprocessing. These are tasks that are called only a few times during a run, and, relative to the computational sections of the code, do not take long to execute. Yet, writing these sections of code in C++ can be very tedious and time-consuming."

    "In some ways, Python is like the polar opposite of C++. Thanks to Python's standard library and a rich ecosystem of external libraries---in scientific computing, projects such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `sympy`, `scikit-learn`, etc. are invaluable---it is (relatively) easy to construct simple user interfaces and data preprocessing and postprocessing pipelines. However, \"vanilla\" Python is slow when you you need to perform an expensive scientific calculation. This can be mitigated by `numpy` and `pandas` if your calculation is amenable to vectorization. However, if the loops in your calculation depend on one another, such as time-dependent simulations or computations that require the use of an iterative solver, then Python's limitations quickly become apparent."

    "> [[Cython]](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/overview.html#cython) is a programming language that makes writing C extensions for the Python language as easy as Python itself. It aims to become a superset of the [Python](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/overview.html#python) language which gives it high-level, object-oriented, functional, and dynamic programming. Its main feature on top of these is support for optional static type declarations as part of the language. The source code gets translated into optimized C/C++ code and compiled as Python extension modules. This allows for both very fast program execution and tight integration with external C libraries, while keeping up the high programmer productivity for which the Python language is well known.\n",
