Homework 0 — Describe a Parallel Application
================
Due: February 1, 2019 @ 11:59pm

## Instructions

First, include a brief bio of you, your research interests, and what you’d like to get out of the class.
This will help us form initial assignment groups, and later this will help you find project partners.

Examine an application problem for which parallel computing has been used.
You may pick a problem from your own research area, somewhere on the web, or elsewhere (so long as it is verifiable).
Build a web page briefly describing the application, the use of parallelism, and a frank assessment of its success, weaknesses, and challenges.

Some specific details to consider include the following:

  - What is the scientific or engineering problem being solved?

  - How well did the application achieve its scientific / engineering objective? Are simulation results compared to physical results?

  - What parallel platform has the application targeted? (distributed vs. shared memory, vector, etc.) What tools were used to build the application? (languages, libraries, etc.)

  - If the application is run on a major supercomputer, where does that computer rank on the [Top 500](https://www.top500.org/) list?

  - How well did the application perform? How does this compare to the platform’s best possible performance?

  - Does the application “scale” to large problems on many processors? If you believe it has not, what bottlenecks may have limited its performance?

Not all of these details will be available for all applications.
You ought to explain what you find noteworthy about the application or its implementation.

The write-up should be 1 – 2 pages in length, single-spaced (if you include a figure, then a third is okay).
The document’s structure and formatting should be formal and any references you use should be cited and listed in a *References* section at the bottom of the document.
Pick a scientific citation style (I don’t care which one, but pick one) and be consistent with it.

## Resources

Besides [Google](https://www.google.com), you can look at the results from previous classes (at UC Berkeley) for inspiration:

  - [Spring 2018](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aditya/local_hw0/results.html)
  - [Spring 2017](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/cs267-spring-2017/home/hw0-results)
  - [Spring 2016](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mme/cs267-2016/hw0/results.html)

## How to submit

Export your write-up to PDF format and upload it to the following two locations:

1.  Homework 0 assignment listing on Blackboard
